# Question-Generation Literature 
The automation script of this repo is powered by [Auto-Bibfile](https://github.com/wutong8023/Auto-Bibfile.git), which is a wonderful open-source tool for collecting literature. You can directly use our bibtex.bib in overleaf with this [link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rgscdxhxbwhp).

Due to time limitation, many of the contents have not been updated, such as 'Taxonomy', and we will update it as soon as possible.

This page categorizes the literature by the **Continual Learning Setting**.
